# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analysis using Python, PostgreSQL and PowerBI
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning using Python, querying the data using SQL, and visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal of this project is to showcase practical skills required for a Data Analyst role, including data manipulation, analysis, querying, and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset contains customer-level transactional data.
It includes information such as:
Customer demographics
Purchase history
Product categories
Subscription status
Ratings and spending behavior

Tools & Technologies Used
Python – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
SQL – Data querying and analysis
PostgreSQL / MySQL
Power BI – Interactive dashboard and reporting
Jupyter Notebook – Python analysis environment
Git & GitHub – Version control

Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)
Imported the dataset using Pandas
Verified schema, data types, and structure

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed data distribution and trends
Identified missing values and outliers
Performed summary statistics and visual analysis

3️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Standardized categorical fields
Removed duplicates and corrected data types

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
Loaded cleaned data into the database
Executed SQL queries to:
Analyze customer behavior
Calculate revenue metrics
Segment customers
Extract KPIs for dashboard use

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to SQL database
Created interactive visuals and KPIs
Added slicers for dynamic filtering

Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard provides business-focused insights such as:
Total number of customers
Average purchase amount
Revenue by category
Subscription-based customer distribution
Customer rating analysis
Gender and category filters for interactivity
The dashboard is designed for clarity, usability, and decision-making.

 ey Results & Insights
Identified high-revenue product categories
Analyzed customer subscription trends
Observed spending behavior across demographics
Enabled interactive filtering for deeper insights
Converted raw data into actionable business intelligence
